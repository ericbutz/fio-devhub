# Program Overview
The FIO bug bounty program, managed and funded by the Foundation, is focused on identifying issues and problems that can impact the entire ecosystem.  These could include: 
- Loss of User Funds
- Exposure of private information (keys, PII)
- Incorrect or inconsistent query results

However, bugs that are already known are not considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program, as well as other things listed as out-of-scope in the relevant section below. Bug bounty hunters submit bug reports at their own risk of being rejected as a known issue.

## Rewards for security vulnerabilities

We are currently evaluating the implementation of a monetary rewards program. Until that program is in place, vulnerability reporters who work with us to resolve security bugs in our products will receive “reward points” and be credited on the FIO Hall of Fame (if desired). If we file an internal security bug, we will acknowledge your contribution on that page. Qualification for reward points are determined by a reward panel consisting members of the FIO community, including foundation members, wallet members, and block producers.

Reward points will be allocated according to:

* Volume: The more valid bug reports you’ve sent in, the more points you get. Points are deducted for spurious reports.
* Severity: For those bugs, how severe are they? Better bugs earn more points.
* Recency: The most recent bug reports receive maximum points. Bug reports older than 6 months lose an increasing proportion of their points over time.
